Pandas DataFrame practice with interview-style questions
This repository contains my hands-on practice of Pandas DataFrame concepts, including:

- DataFrame creation
- Column and row selection using loc and iloc
- Sorting and ranking
- Handling missing values
- Conditional updates
- Common interview-style Pandas questions

I have also documented common errors and fixes for better learning.
